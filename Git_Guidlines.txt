GIT GUIDELINES
When using git:
1. you need to create a new repository for the files to be sent to:
    this can be done by using the git init command in the terminal portal or the comand portal near the location of the required files
    git init (create an empty repository)
2. to add the files to the local repository:
    use git add . (to add all files) 
    or 
    git add fils_name to add particular files
3. commit the changes before pushing it into git:
    git commit -m "comment line"
4. The link the repository by copying the link:
    git remote add origin (enter the link of the repository)
    remember the branch name here.
5. finally, push the changes from the local repository to the git which is a non local repository and can be accessed from anywhere and any device:
    git push -u origin (branch_name)
These steps are to be done first and later when editing the content in the repository;
we simply 
* use git add. 
* followed by the commit 
*and pushing the file or changes made into the repository respectively.
